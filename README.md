# Convolutional-neural-network-CNN-for-flowers-classiffication
In this project a convolutiona neural network is used to classify flowers images.
To perform this project, first of all a zip file of the images is uploaded to google drive.
The data set is uploaded here for this project.
zip file is then unzipped in google colab.
